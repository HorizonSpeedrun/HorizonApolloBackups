# Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered

The Base file provided here is the imported save by Aussie.

The file might not have enough Sparker for the current Stormslinger strats of NG+ Story.

## Save Game location
- Steam: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered\<id>`

## Installation instructions
Rename the file to one of the numbers and place it in the save game location.

Modifying the save for identification is a bit more involved. Open the file in a HEX-Editor and overwrite the description pretty early in the file. Pay attention to not change the total size of the save. Pad with 0-bytes if needed. For easy recognition the file has been wrapped in `===`.
