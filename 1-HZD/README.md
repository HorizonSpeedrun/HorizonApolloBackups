# Horizon Zero Dawn (Original)

The Base saves and Segment Saves are provided by Aussie.

The NG+ Basefile might not have enough Sparker for the current Stormslinger strats of NG+ Story.

## Save Game location
- Steam: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Horizon Zero Dawn\Saved Game`

## Installation instructions
For the original Zero Dawn game, saves are structured into folders. To apply the saves, put the 3 files into one of the 10 `manualsavengp###` folders.

To easily identify the savefile, you can change the image of the save, e.g. by writing text on the image. Changing the `slotinfo.ini` data doesn't get correctly shown in the game.
