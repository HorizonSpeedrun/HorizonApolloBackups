# Horizon Forbidden West

The files here are provided by Greedy and ISO.

## Save Game location
- Steam: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition\<id>`

## Installation instructions
Rename the file to one of the numbers and place it in the save game location. The number is not limited.

Modifying the save for identification is a bit more involved. Open the file in a HEX-Editor and overwrite the description pretty early in the file. Pay attention to not change the total size of the save. Pad with 0-bytes if needed. For easy recognition the files have been wrapped in `===`.
